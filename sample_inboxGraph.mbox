I really like your skin design. The clear typographically structuring
of the menus, the use of color and the placement of logos and
background image would make it very useful for commercial and private
sites.

Would you consider donating it to our skin pool? Or short of that share
the code so that others can copy bits and pieces of it?

As you might know Ross and I have put considerable time into working
on a chapter structure for a book on Single Source Publishing with
Forrest. Since we didn't follow through with the project (there will
only be a German book) we are prepared to donate this structure (more
precisely: the rights to this concept for an English publication) as a
basis for the Forrest documentation project.

It might need some adjustments of course, but it was designed to
introduce people with basic skills to Forrest so it seems compatible
with what Addi had in mind.

If people think this is helpful, I'd check the OpenOffice file with
the concept into the issue tracker so that people can study it and add
their comments and suggestions (preferably as a modified
OpenOffice-document). Or is OpenOffice too proprietary to work with?

Once we have finalized the chapter structure, we could create it as a
new tab on Forrest main site with each chapter becoming a menu item
pointing to a page with a short abstract for this chapter (not being
written yet) and instructions on what to do if person wants to write
and contribute this chapter.

All open chapters could also become items in the issue tracker but I
think that having them in a structured menu helps recognizing at what
point in the documentation this chapter is placed and what its
purpose is.

I'm in favour of not writing a whole lot of basic documentation as
FAQs and standalone documents because the unstructured web of docs
created that way is much harder to comprehend (getting lost in the
web) and also a pain to maintain in the long run.

Hello Claudia,
     I agree with Soethe's view. This is really a pretty site!

     With my limited knowledge, presently I can't fully comprehend how
it was done using Forrest ! Would love to know at least how such things =

can be done :)

Praveen

Not sure what your mean by "rights to this concept". See the Apache License 2.0

We can sure study it, but we need comments to come back to this mailing list.
We can't have design discussions shut away in separate documents.

Anyway, we have got to see what you are talking about first. I don't
really understand the three paragraphs below yet.

It would help to present a high-level overview to this mailing list.

Actually Ferdinand, this discussion should be happening on the dev list.

We reserve the user list for questions an assistance. Development discussions
can get quite busy and touch many different topics. We don't want to frighten
new users away with that.

Hi Ferdinand!

First of all thanks for the praise - we feel flattered :)

We see no problem in sharing our skin-code, but beware - we had to bend 
some rules in certain areas (e.g. changing stuff in skins/common/xslt) 
to achieve what we wanted. There possibly are ways to prevent these 
changes (especially in the 0.7 codebase - which we haven't looked at yet).

We started the website in December 2004 where documentation was rather 
sparse and spent a lot of time learning things the hard way so possibly 
not all of our solutions are 'by the book'.

Our skin is based on the 'pelt' skin codebase which was mercilessly 
ripped apart where we felt the need to do so. We dropped support for 
things we didn't need (e.g. project/group logos, collapseable menues, 
etc.) and changed the layout of the top-strip.

So if this hasn't scared you yet, please contact us on how we may give 
back to the community.

Regards,

Claudia

There is no need to change the common files, simply override the=20
templates you need to change in your own skin. We can show you how to do =

this when working on your skin package donation.

The Open Source way is to take code and polish it, so no worries there.

I would love to see your skin made available (I too like it a great=20
deal). However, we need to discuss exactly how to accept this donation=20
over on the dev list (this mail is copied to the dev list and replies=20
will be sent there).

In the past Forrest has not wanted to accept new skins because we do not =

have the resources to maintain them. Consequently, we added a=20
skin-packaging system that allowed people to develop skins and make them =

available via an automatic download mechanism.

The hope was that we would be able to encourage people, such as=20
yourself, to make their skins available via a zip download from their=20
sites. The benefit would be more eyes on the skin and thus improvements=20
would be sent back to you.

Unfortunately, we have not exploited this feature. Now is the time for=20
us to do so, and your skin can be the first example of that feature=20
(would you believe it was added in 0.5 and we still don't use it - shame =

on us)

I think Forrest should accept your skin package in one form or another,=20
the question is how, I see our options as:

1. Forrest accepts the skin and keeps it in SVN

I am -0 on this. We need to would then be forced to maintain the skin=20
and ensure that it is "correct" in the sense of everything is done the=20
right way. I would prefer we only maintain the one skin in our core and=20
utilise the skin packaging system in order to add more skins.

2. We make all non-core skins available via a skins sub project within=20
Forrest

In this instance we would create a new project for contributed skins.=20
Anyone donating a skin will automatically get commit access to this=20
sub-project (but not to Forrest itself).

I am +1 for this if it is possible within the Apache Infrastructure. It=20
ensures that there will be at least one person with commit access with a =

vested interest in maintaining the skin and in applying any contributed=20
patches.

Does the way our SVN is set up allow this?

3. The skin author makes it available via a ZIP download using the=20
skin-package system

I am +0 for this. I would prefer to see a solution that makes the skin=20
available through a version control mechanism to simplify patches. If=20
only a skin-package zip is provided it will make it difficult for people =

to contribute to the skin.

4. The skin author donates the skin to an external Open Source project=20
and uses that projects CVS/SVN etc.

This is kind of a half way house between option 2 and option 3. In the=20
past we tried to set-up a Sourceforge project for this, but it was=20
rejected as the project would not generate program code. I will offer=20
the Burrokeet project on SF since this uses Forrest at its core so the=20
housing of Forrest skins is appropriate within that project. I do not=20
have any problems adding skin contributors to that project to ensure=20
they have commit access. Of course, there may be other projects that are =

appropriate.


---

Whatever we do, we should encourage the use of skin packages and we=20
should extend the system to list "official" skins in the same way the=20
plugin system does, see=20
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/plugins/index.html

Comments, ideas?

Lets take it gradually. With those changes that you say you
needed to make to the "common" section, if there are any
that you can contribute, then that would make it easier
for your updating later.

However as Ross indicated in another thread, the skin system
is designed to be able to over-ride xsl templates in the
"common" with templates in the skin. There are many examples
of this in the existing skins.

The Apache Software Foundation is a proud partner of Google Summer of
Code initiative (http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html).

The Summer of Code is a program designed to introduce students to the
world of Open Source Software Development and provide them with
a $4500 award for completing an Open Source project before the end of
Summer.

The Apache Forrest project currently has one project proposal as part of 
the Summer of Code, more may be added later. For details see 
http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2005#forrest-voice

The deadline for application is June 14th so if you are interested you 
need act quickly. Competition is very high for these projects, but then 
so are the rewards.

Currently the JSPWiki format pages have to be copied into a standard 
Forrest site. That is they are not pulled dynamically from the JSP wiki 
application. If you are using 0.6 then there is a sample in a fresh 
site. If you are using 0.7-dev then you will find the functionality in 
the wiki plugin 
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.wiki/

There are a number of initiatives in this direction at the moment. The 
0.8 release will be able to publish content from a number of CMSs and 
repository systems, currently being considered and experimented with is 
a Daisy plugin (http://www.cocoondev.org/daisy ) a Lenya plugin 
(http://lenya.apache.org ) and a Slide plugin 
(http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/index.html )

We would be more than happy to work with you on a JSPWiki plugin 
providing tighter integration than is currently possible. But we'll have 
to do that over on the dev list. In order to do this you will need 
reasonable XSLT skills and a knowledge of JSPWiki. We can help you 
design the solution.

Thanks David

I am using the TortoiseSVN graphical user interfase on windows.

Could not dedicate much time in this days to the forrest project. 

I also spend some time asking to the TortoiseSVN (TSVN) list and trying out
their advice to the same cuestion. Since it is working now I will put a copy
here:

----
Advice:

Try https:// instead of http:// - seems you're behind a firewall/proxy which
rejects DAV requests. By using https://, you 'trick' the firewall/proxy so
that it doesn't recognize those requests anymore.

Or: configure your firewall/proxy to let DAV requests through.

End of the advice 
----

I used https and succeeded. Now I will ask the firewall/proxy administrator
for the DAV request.

When I use the TSVN client, it asks me for a fingerprint which I accept and
continues. I hope that's correct.

Please tell us the exact 'svn' command that you are trying to use.

OK, I should have said "knowledge of how to get the raw format documents 
out of JSPWiki using wither a java or htpp API". That is the only 
knowledge required and is a question that should be easily answered by 
the JSPWiki devs.

Having said that both Lenya and Daisy provide WYSIWYG editing 
environments and so may be more appropriate to your use case since you 
are looking for simplicity of content editing.

Hi,

I have seen in the documentation that you are compatible with the 
jspwiki syntax for sources.
So, I would like to know if someone has already setup this configuration 
(JSPWiki for writing the docs and Forrest to produce both HTML and PDF).
If yes :
- how to automatically "import" jspwiki pages into forrest ?
- how to organize the pages in function of the wiki "structure" (i.e 
produce tabs.xml and site.xml in function of categories) ?
- how to create one pdf per tab ? (there is the documentation but where 
are the .xsl)

The interest is to allow non technical people (i.e unfamiliar with xml) 
to write the doc but to have a professionnal render throught Forrest.

Regards,

chris

Ooops that doc should not be in the 0.6 docs then.

You can find the stylesheets in our SVN see

Sorry Ross but I have no knowledge of JSPWiki so I cannot help for a 
JSPWiki plugin.
BTW, I will look at Daisy and Lenya as I think they can be appropriate 
for the task I want to do

Hi,

I am trying to make 1 pdf /tab but the stylesheets used for the 
transformation are not available in the forrest 0.6 release.
i.e my pdf-tab.xml :

<map:transform src="resources/stylesheets/site2book.xsl" />
<map:transform src="resources/stylesheets/aggregates/book2cinclude.xsl">
<map:transform src="resources/stylesheets/aggregates/doc2doc-uniqueids.xsl"/>
<map:transform src="resources/stylesheets/aggregates/docs2document.xsl"/>

but I do not find the *.xsl

Regards,

chris

It works just fine for me with latest SVN, try doing a svn up and 
"forrest clean site"

Also when using SVN, after doing 'svn update' you really need to do
'build clean; build' especially when there are changes to the core
parts of Forrest.

I am trying to integrate another content type, one based on a published 
document schema from a standards association (hr-xml.org). However, it 
is not being transformed to xdoc;  I think that I am having trouble with 
the "sitemap.xmap" interception and would appreciate clues as to how to 
get it right. I have simply copied the "download" example and changed 
"download" to "resume" :

>   <map:pipeline>
>    <map:match pattern="**Resume.xml">
>     <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}{1}Resume.xml" />
>     <map:transform 
> src="{project:resources.stylesheets}/resume2document.xsl" />
>     <map:serialize type="xml"/>
>    </map:match>
>   </map:pipeline>

However, when I try to use my test stylesheet as "resume2document", 
"ResumeExample2.html" has no content. When I pull "ResumeExample2.xml" 
in my browser, I get the raw untransformed xml file.  So it looks like 
my stylesheet is not being applied, because my document is not matching 
the pattern. How should I fix my <map:pipeline> match in sitemap.xml?  
Is the match pattern not applied to the document type (see "B." below)?  
Is it because I have two <map:pipeline> groups in my sitemap, one for 
"download" followed by one for "Resume"?

Regards,
Maurice

P.S.  I have checked :

A.  I have successfully gone through the "download" example.  Forrest 
finds my stylesheets, applies sitemap.xmap.

B.  Sample document validation.  Running "Forrest -v validate" succeeds, 
i.e. Forrest appears to resolve and utilise the appropriate xsd. Forrest 
also validates the sitemap.xmap (after noting the absence of several 
subsidiary xmap files to set property version-specific-sitemap).
The sample document "ResumeExample2.xml"  I downloaded from a standards 
organization.  The document validates to their schema :    

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Resume xml:lang="EN" xmlns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2004-08-02" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
xsi:schemaLocation="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2_3/HR-XML-2_3/SEP/Resume.xsd">

C.  My stylesheet: the trivial 
"./resources/stylesheets/resume2document.xsl" (listed below) works for 
"download".

<!-- a trivial transform doc-root to xdoc  stylesheet, should work for 
any schema or DTD  -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet
  version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

  <xsl:template match="/">

It would be better to do this as a plugin as it would be useful to a 
wider community. Are you using 0.7? If not you cannot build it as a 
plugin. I would recomend changing to 0.7 (it is stable enough being very 
close to a release).

Building a plugin is really easy, see 
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/howto/howto-buildPlugin.html

The pipeline above matches "**Resume.xml", your file is called 
"ResumeExample2.xml" which will not be matched. You need a match of 
"Resume*.xml".

However, you should avoid limiting the URL space of your application by 
requiring a given file type to have a given filename or path. This can 
result in false matches. You should use the SourceTypeResolver, for an 
example of how see 
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/forrest/trunk/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.simplified-docbook/input.xmap?view=markup 
for an example of how to do this.

{NOTE TO DEVS: fresh-site shows a custom DTD being used in the way 
Maurice is doing this, we need to update this sample - I'll add an issue)

I've just now read the docs on plugins you pointed to, and I understand 
why you recommend that route.  For various personal reasons, I'm waiting 
for 0.7 distribution, and am not in a position to build from sources 
myself. But it seems like my resume2document.xsl stylesheet could be 
reused in an input plugin later without making changes, just packaging 
it.  Is that not true?

Okay, I was presuming that the matching was done on the document type, 
not the file name. Indeed, that is straightforward to patch, and I can 
now get my transform output rendered.  Thank you very much! I can start 
to make some progress on developing my transformation.

I totally buy your point about not requiring a document type to have a 
given file name or path.  Since I'm trying to use or produce xml files 
which have the ".xml" extension rather than something more distinctive, 
I would like Forrest to choose the stylesheet on the basis of the 
doctype, perhaps using a catalog (like for resolving DTDs...why not 
catalogs for xsl?).  It looks like that is what happens in the 
<map:resources> group in the example you pointed me to (below).  My 
first attempt to *bend* it to my purpose failed, however: "Type 
'sourcetype' does not exist for 'map:pipeline' at..." when I replaced

  <map:pipeline>
   <map:match pattern="**Resume.xml">
by
  <map:pipeline type="sourcetype" src="{src}">
        <map:select type="parameter">
          <map:parameter name="parameter-selector-test" 
value="{sourcetype}" />
          <map:when test="Resume">

But one thing at a time...xslt first, then plugin/resolving.

Many thanks,
Maurice

I updated to build 180154.

It still doesn't give a clean build. I even tried to build the docs:

cd site-author
forrest available-plugins
forrest init-plugins
forrest clean site

...

Ok is this build.sh to javac all the sources. Where is
org.cyberneko.dtd.DTDConfiguration? Maybe a conflict
with my 1.4 sdk? Anyway I'll try a rebuild.

You need to copy the section that defines the sourcetype component too 
(see <map:components>) in the above linked sitemap.

I should have been more explicit. Ross told you only part of the
solution.

** If you do 'svn update' then you must clean and re-build core Forrest. **

I will go and make that clear in the http://forrest.apache.org/docs/build.html
It is there, just not bold enough ... a use for the xdocs <warning> element.

Anyway, see below ...

Please do it. Some of the Neko libraries were moved out of
main Forrest core and into the plugins.

This is another reason for doing the 'cd main; build clean; build'
It forces you to clean out the plugins and re-deploy them.

Hi,
   I use forrest 0.6. I use eclipse and have written an ant script to start
Forrest from ant through eclipse. (eg forrest run, forrest site etc). (The
forrest
0.7 plugin for eclipse I have tried earlier, but decided to wait for
The whole integeration to stabilize before using it it in my project....)

I face problem in stopping the jetty server opened by 'forrest run' through
ant in eclipse. The only end command that I 
Can find is to to terminate the process in which eclipse has started
Ant for 'forrest run'. This stops the ant script BUT does not stop the jetty
As I can check that it is yet running in localhost://8888 inspite of the
process 
Being stopped.

Is there a way to STOP the jetty server started by 'forrest run' through ant
Script in eclipse?

Thanks
Praveen

No, the "catalog entity resolver" addresses a separate part of the issue.
It sounds like we need to enhance the documentation. Source Type Resolver,
actually called "SourceTypeAction (content aware pipelines)" [2] is one of
the key features of Forrest and so we need to explain it better.

Lets first correct your comment about "catalog". Its use is to create
an efficient system for xml documents that declare a DTD so that the
xml parser gets a local copy rather than going across the network.

Now back to Source Type Action ... It is a Cocoon sitemap component that
peeks at the top-part of a document to look for hints about the type
of the document. 

[1] http://forrest.apache.org/docs/your-project.html#sitemap.xmap 
[2] http://forrest.apache.org/docs/cap.html

These are the available methods:
document-declaration
document-element and namespace
processing-instruction
w3c-xml-schema

If you use the first technique, then the parser needs to go retrieve
the DTD from across the network. Hence the need for Catalog Entity Resolver.

I don't use "w3c-xml-schema" so i am not sure if the parser is forced
to locate the actual schema. I gather that it doesn't. Therefore you
don't need to mess about with catalogs.

Now if there are Java people out there listening, then perhaps you would
like to enhance the Source Type Action to enable other methods. It is in
the Forrest source at main/java/org/apache/forrest/sourcetype

Sorry if I wasn't clear.  When I referred to using *a* catalog (not 
*the* catalogs used for validation resolving) I meant just the concept 
of a look-up table the pipeline could use to identify a 
document-type-specific handling to apply.  That seems to be what is 
being done in the sitemap.  If I understand your SourceTypeAction doc 
and what is being defined in the input.xmap (url above),
a) one can define classification rules for xml documents based on some 
types of document header information,
b) apply these rules to determine a "sourcetype" (=classification)
c) use the "sourcetype" (classification) to select the processing to apply.

a) is done in the map:actions section, as you explain in the doc.

b) is done by "map:act" (=a function call) when the document is 
encountered and a processing decision is to be taken:

<map:act type="sourcetype" src="{1}">
or 
<map:act type="sourcetype" src="{src}">

c) Is done by a "select:parameter-selector-test:when" construct 
resembling a select-case in a "resource" (=subroutine) named 
"transform-to-document":

<map:resource name="transform-to-document">
      <map:act type="sourcetype" src="{src}">
        <map:select type="parameter">
          <map:parameter name="parameter-selector-test" value="{sourcetype}" />

          <map:when test="docbook-v4.1.2">
            <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}{../../1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="{forrest:plugins}/org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.simplified-docbook/resources/stylesheets/sdocbook2document.xsl" />
            <map:serialize type="xml-document"/>
          </map:when>
...

While reading the SourceTypeAction doc, a couple of questions came to 
mind.  I think it would be helpful to find their answers in that doc. :

1) What is the appropriate way to construct "OR" classification rules?  
For instance, the document-element may return a local-name, a namespace, 
or both. Should one define two (or more) rules with the same sourcetype 
name, such as...

<sourcetype name="foo">
    <document-element local-name="foo">
</sourcetype>
<sourcetype name="foo">
    <document-element namespace="bar">
</sourcetype>

or a single rule with a list of alternative conditions, such as...

<sourcetype name="foo">
    <document-element local-name="foo">
    <document-element namespace="bar">
</sourcetype>

or is there some other syntax?

2) How does one construct "AND" classification rules?

<sourcetype name="foo">
    <document-element local-name="foo"> && <document-element namespace="bar">
</sourcetype>


These are not urgent (for me), but I expect they will be wanted sooner 
or later.

Regards and thanks for the communication,
Maurice

I am using this dirty hack of calling

C:\WINDOWS\system32\taskkill.exe /F /IM java.exe

that works without me understanding why it doesn't bring down eclipse
as well. But it does.

The proper way might be to look at the jetty documentation on the web
(http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/faq?s=100-FAQ&t=Z2).
There is a port that you can call to stop the server.

Set up an external application (i.e. "Project Run..."). This will keep a 
console winodw open for the Forrest instance, you can then close it by 
clicking the "stop" button. However...

There is an Eclipse plugin in our tools directory. Still alphs stage but 
you can start/stop and build sites, There are also a couple of basic 
wizards for seeding new projects and add new Xdocs.

Currently there is a dependency on some external code, but that project 
has voted to donate the code to Apache. I just have to merge it into our 
SVN. In the meantime it is avaialble from the CVS of the 
http://www.burrokeet.org project

I have tried some other things and the results of that made me think
this problem actually does have anything to do with the the configured
stylesheets. I am positive that it is not related to the content itself,
because:
- When I copy the 'corrupt' file and link to it, it works flawless.
- When I rename the 'corrupt' file, and alter the link, it works
flawless as well.

So the workaround for now is to change the file names, albeit a bit of a
poor mens solution.

Hi,

it is not possible to me to unsubscribe from this mailing list, because =
the
email address generated by EZMLM for confirming the unsubscription is
rejected by our mail server (MS Exchange), which the following message
shows:

Could you please manually remove me from that list?

Additionally it would be recommended to provide alternative methods for
unsubscribing as Mailman for example provides (web-based and parsing of
commands in the mail body).

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi. I'm a newbie to Forrest and to all of the sources of information available so if this is covered somewhere already, sorry.

I was wondering if it was possible to customize the title page in the pdf with a logo. I assume the change would go into document2fo.xsl in my skin folder, but I'm not sure how to do it. I've got experience with XML and XSLT, but none with xsl-fo.

Also, while I have your eyes, how do you change the text color in the horinontal tabs. I'm in the process of trying to use an image for the background of these tabs and need to change the color. I somehow managed to change the font-family but I've made several changes and I'm not sure which one accomplished the change. Pretty silly, I know.

If you've got a link for me, that would be great.

Thanks in advance.

I'm not certain which file is required for this modification (I think 
your assumption is correct). If you need help with the XSL-FO portion, 
you can ask on one of the mailing lists on the FOP Resources page:

http://xml.apache.org/fop/resources.html#mailing-lists

I'm thinking the Mulberry XSL List would be best:
http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/

In addition, there are some great FAQs and other helpful links at the 
bottom of this page:
http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/

Sorry for the double posting. I couldn't find my post and I thought that something had gone wrong so I tried sending again.

My apologizes. I'm usually not this spaced out.
And thanks for the replies to the original post.

Thanks

rebuilding forrest core
sorted out the problem of building
dtdx plugin

===

Any way of building all updated plugins
as a result of
svn up

At the moment I
cd plugins
forrest available-plugins

then cd into every plugin directory and do
forrest clean; forrest
(build.xml dependencey does init-plugin?)

You could just leave them unbuilt. Forrest will automatically download 
them for you when they are needed. If you happen to be offline at the 
time then you can ant local-deploy the ones required.

However, this is something we *should* do. It comes up reasonably 
frequently. Patches to the ant scripts are welcome from anyone who has 
the time.

Hi,

as this my first mail to the mailing list, a short introduction: Looking
for a good tool for my new homepage I came across forrest and liked both
the basic idea (similar to xweb (xweb.sourceforge.net) which I
considered before) and the quite advanced features. Using forrest 0.5.1
I created a first website which I used until recently. When asked to
create a website for a software project (conexp.sf.net, nothing there
yet) I found that some details of the configuration changed from 0.5.1
to 0.6. Noticing further that more changes are to come with the step
from 0.6 to 0.7 I decided to try 0.7-dev. If any of my problems stem
from using the development verstion, please tell me so. However, I was
not able to find any bug report or todo item concerning the difficulties
I encountered (then again, I am probably looking for the wrong
keywords). For testing I use the pelt skin, another one derived from
pelt.

I have some practical experience with Java, XML/XSLT and CSS. However,
as forrest brings all of those together I find it difficult to find out
where exactly the issue I want to solve comes from. Any hints on good
tools to track down CSS and XSLT issues are welcome.

Here the problem: (menus and menu-entries in the same menu)

A sketch of my site.xml:

<site tab="">
   <subcat label="Subcat" href="subcat/">
     <entry1 label="Entry1" href="entry1.html" tab="subcat"/>
     <entry2 label="Entry2" href="entry2.html" tab="subcat"/>
   </subcat>
   <contact label="Contact" href=""/>
</site>

Using a tabs.xml like
<tabs>
  <tab id="" label="Main" dir=""/>
  <tab id="subcat" label="Subcat" dir="subcat"/>
</tabs>

What I expected were two menus like this:
Home+
    |-Subcat
    +Contact

(with "Subcat" and "Contact" being clickable, changing two the
corresponding subcategory/contact page) and

Subcat+
      |-Entry1
      +Entry2

However, I get

Home+
    |-Subcat+
            |-Entry1
            +-Entry2

(having Subcat as a dynamic menu, but not linked to the subcategory) and

Subcat+
      +-Subcat+
              |-Entry1
              +-Entry2

(duplicating unnecessarily the "Subcat" label).

Can please anyone tell me how to change the menus?

Thanks in advance,

heco

PS: Another problem were the <credits>-Tags. Not having them,
common/skinconf.xsl inserted a credit for Apache Forrest. However, the
comment in skinconf.xml says "Comment out the whole <credit>-element if
you want no credits in the web pages".

Ah i see. I still had to correct your comments, otherwise other users
would be seriously confused. I was. Anyway, it is good because it
provides a chance to better explain these facilities.

I hope that you started at reference #1 and followed the background
reading. What this is showing is that we need much better documents
about our SourceTypeAction and that Cocoon needs a very high-level
document to explain its sitemap. Perhaps the Cocoon documents that
we refer to are too technical.

Sorry, i don't have much time today, so only quick comments.

The Cocoon sitemap is not a logic-based programming language.
There are no constructs like boolean AND/OR between the
sitemap elements. Its language is more like XSL.

One way would be to assign different sourcetype@name attributes
in the <map:action> and then in the <pipelines> part of the sitemap
you would have separate matches which just repeat the same processing.
e.g.

  <sourcetype name="foo">
    <document-element local-name="foo">
  </sourcetype>
  <sourcetype name="bar">
    <document-element namespace="bar">
  </sourcetype>
...
...
      <map:when test="foo">
       <map:transform
          src="{project:resources.stylesheets}/foobar2document.xsl" />
      </map:when>
      <map:when test="bar">
       <map:transform
          src="{project:resources.stylesheets}/foobar2document.xsl" />
      </map:when>
...

You could also search the Cocoon documentation and wiki.
You might find other examples of <map:select> that show
better uses of the <map:when test="...
perhaps that test can be more complete.

I don't know if that is possible or needed. Perhaps there is another way.
It would be better if you provided an actual use-case.

Using your example from earlier in this thread, AND would be:

i.e. test for each individual action and duplicate the transform code. 
What duplicate code - that is bad (I herar you shout). You are of course 
correct, so the sitemap provides a thing called resources to allow the 
duplicate code to be refactored out and replaced with a 
<map:call-resource...

(note the above example was directly copied for the suggestion for OR, 
obviously in an OR you would have different actions within the test)

See the simplified-docbook plugins input.xmap file for an example of the 
use of resources like this.

Try something like this :

<site tab="home">
	<home label="Home" tab="home">
	   <subcat label="Subcat" href="subcat/">
	     <entry1 label="Entry1" href="entry1.html"/>

At the moment, the credits are only displayed in the index.html page - 
it is hard coded in skins but the problem is known...
You don't have this page...

Hi,

thanks for the quick response, however it did not work out.

I read that the tag-attribute is inherited by all child elements. I
experimented with and without this.

I replaced the complex subcat-entry by just
           <subcat label="Subcat" href="subcat/">

changed to:
    <tab id="home" label="Home" dir="" />
(is this a problem?)

> > <tab id="subcat" label="Subcat" dir="subcat"/>

Here I added:
    <tab id="contact" label="Contact" dir=""/>

> ></tabs>

The behaviour is now as follows: Clicking on the Home or Subcat tabs, I
get 

Home+      (<- even when clicking on Subcat, the Home tab is highlighted(?))
    +-Home+
    |     |-Subcat
    |     +-Contact
    +-Subcat+
            |-Entry1
            +-Entry2

Clicking on Entry1 brings (almost) the desired result:
Subcat+ (<- correctly highlighted)
      +Subcat+ (<- unnecessary duplication)
             |-(Entry1) (correctly highlighted)
             +-Entry2

I want to get rid of the intermediate level, i.e. clicking on Home only
Home+
    |-Subcat
    +-Contact

and clicking on Subcat

Subcat+  (<- correct tab highlighted)
      |-Entry1
      +-Entry2

Clicking on Contact I only get

...+      (<- no tab highlighted (?) )
   +-Home+
         |-Subcat
         +-(Contact) (<- marked as active)

instead of 
Contact+
       |-Subcat
       +-Contact


Actually, I do not quite get the interplay of site.xml and tabs.xml. At
first I thought that site.xml is basically a pool of nodes which can be
referenced in tabs.xml to build the menus. Duplicating the entries in
site.xml improved the resulting menus, but duplication seems to be a
recipe for confustion for larger sites. Also it means that the
responsibility for the menus is divided between site.xml and tabs.xml.
Is this intentional?

Also, what is the algorithm for determining the tab to be highlighted? I
am surprised that clicking a tab is not marking this tab as active. By
try and error I got the impression that some prefix matching on the href
is done, but I was not able to find the right place in the code (only
looking at the xslt though). Could someone point me out where menu
creation and selected-tab-identification is done? The documentation at
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/linking.html
does not go into much detail. I tried to figure out the whole process by
looking at 
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/sitemap-ref.html
(however, I had not the time for an in-depth look at the linked pages on 
"Cocoon sitemap" or "Cocoon concepts")
It hinted to the tab2menu.xsl stylesheet, but I did not understand it
(in particular, there is a test:
<xsl:when test="@id and @id = $matching-id">
What does it mean that the attribute @id is equal to a result tree
fragment? Could not find info on that.)

Any help welcome. (Also good keywords to search in the mailinglist
archives or bug database.)


Another problem with jetty: How can I teach jetty to look for
subcat/index.html if the link/href only says "subcat/"? Those links work
of course when deploying the website to our normal Apache webserver, but
getting Cocoon errors about "Resource not found" when using "forrest
run" is a little annoying.

Well, I have some - only not in the example. It's easy to fix, but I
didn't know if it is already reported as a bug.

Thanks for all comments, best regards,

Er, i am confused. That code snippet is exactly the same as the OR
situation. Did you forget to edit the code?

Nope, I was being stupid. Seems my logic circuits blew, I thought an OR 
was something completely different. I even added a note to the effect:

>>(note the above example was directly copied for the suggestion for OR, 
>>obviously in an OR you would have different actions within the test)

Just to be clear, the above is obviously an OR, I hope Maurice saw 
through my idiocy and didn't waste much time on that.

I've had almost a whole nights sleep now, so maybe my logic circuits 
have repaired themselves. However, they are not telling me how to do an 
AND I'm afraid.

Hi!

Is anyone currently working on the "Need better
documentation explaining how to use tabs" issue as
listed in the Issue Navigator - ASF Jira (FOR 511).
The ASF JIRA said nobody is assigned the issue and
that it is still unresolved. I have myself encountered
this problem many times while working. Hence, I am
quite keen to solve this issue so that it does not irk
others in future while working.

If nobody is working, then I would like to work on
this with Mr. Ross Gardler as my mentor for the Google
Summer of Code 2005 program.

Pl. advise

Thanks and Regards

Ayush Gupta

Nesting should get the AND effect.  It does seem there's no direct way
about it though.
--tim

For example,

 <map:when test=3D"foo">
      <map:when test=3D"bar">
      <map:transform
          src=3D"{project:resources.stylesheets}/foobar2document.xsl" />
  </map:when>

less lost, and I like to play with color schemes. (but I will get back 
to new content processing soon!). I began by changing colors for pelt.  
To *protect* my changes, I

a) copied and renamed the pelt branch from core/context/skins to 
${project.content-dir}/skins,
  (i.e. src/documentation/skins/stucco/).
b) uncommented the line   project.skins-dir=${project.content-dir}/skins 
in forrest.properties, and
c) added an entry or project.skin=stucco, also in forrest.properties.

The output of 'forrest run' ended with

fetch-versioned-skin:
Trying to get "stucco" skin version
                         0.6...

BUILD FAILED
C:\temp\apache-forrest-0.6\src\core\targets\skins.xml:107: the following 
error occurred while executing this line:
C:\temp\apache-forrest-0.6\src\core\targets\skins.xml:119: the following 
error occurred while executing this line:
C:\...build\tmp\skinlist2fetchbuild.xml:7 
java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol : stucco-0.6.zip

Move my renamed copy to core\context\skins  and commenting out the 
"project.skins-dir" resolved the problem.  But I would like to 
understand how "personal" skins are supposed to be located.

The little detail the annoys me concerns the rounded corners on the 
menu.  When I changed the "body" color I discovered that "body" in this 
skin is not what the content is written on, but what appears below the 
footer (when the page is short) and beneath the menu (in the "layers" 
sense).  So when I changed this color to not white, the "pointy" parts 
of the menu bottom corners showed up.

a)  I found in the screen.css

#roundbottom {
    background-image: url(images/rc-b-r-15-1body-2menu-3menu.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right;
}
Adding an entry in skinconf for
 <color name="content" value="#FFFFFF" />
("content" is not a color name in the standard list, BTW, in neither the 
skinconf.xml for a project nor the skinconf.xsl for pelt, but I find it 
useful in this case)
and changing the roundbottom style to

#roundbottom {
    background-image: url(images/rc-b-r-15-1content-2menu-3menu.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right;
}

worked, but only for the bottom right corner (rc-b-r appears to mean 
roundcorner-bottom-right).  I cannot find the equivalent for the bottom 
left corner anywhere! And its point is still colored...can someone 
please tell me how to fix this corner, too?

One more detail, also on the menu: the background-color on selected menu 
items. This "bold black on light blue" does not seem to be defined in 
the css:
#menu .menupagetitle {
        padding: 0px 0px 0px 6px;
        font-style : normal;
        border-style: solid;
        border-width: 1px;
        margin-right: 10px;
}
I would like to make it better match the rest of my color scheme.  It is 
not horrible, but could be better.

Regards,
Maurice

P.S. I did realize that the <map: > construct did "OR" and not "AND". I 
hope the sleep helps, Ross!

Hello,

I found an answer to one of my own questions.

Q: The little detail the annoys me concerns the rounded corners on the 
menu.  When I changed the "body" color I discovered that "body" in this 
skin is not what the content is written on, but what appears below the 
footer (when the page is short) and beneath the menu (in the "layers" 
sense).  So when I changed this color to not white, the "pointy" parts 
of the menu bottom corners showed up.

A: The bottom-left corner is set in site2xhtml.xsl:
        <div id="roundbottom">
            <img 
                src="{$skin-img-dir}/rc-b-l-15-1body-2menu-3menu.png" 
                alt="" width="15" height="15" class="corner" 
                style="display: none" />
        </div>

Changing the src to "{$skin-img-dir}/rc-b-l-15-1content-2menu-3menu.png" makes its point disappear, too.


It works!  But I'm even more confused now. It has "display: none" and it 
is in a div with id=roundbottom, so why is the hidden image displayed 
instead of the roundbottom(rc-b-r- ) background-image?  Off-topic, skip 
it...I'll work it out.


Regards,
Maurice



a) I found in the screen.css

#roundbottom {
background-image: url(images/rc-b-r-15-1body-2menu-3menu.png);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: top right;
}
Adding an entry in skinconf for
<color name="content" value="#FFFFFF" />

Hi. Newbie Forrest guy again.
I was wondering if there was a way to change where Forrest puts the site folder when it builds a project. I need to dump it into a distribution folder and not its default location.

Links or other info would be great. I'm on digest mode, so if you could cc me on responses, that would be great.

Thanks in advance.

The colors for the toolbox are in profile.css (two separate lines about 
15 lines apart).

#menu .menupagetitle  { background-color: #12306C;}
#menu .menupagetitle  { color: #000000;}

That "selected menu items" box (menupagetitle) is referred to as the 
toolbox in skinconf.xml.  Currently pelt's skinconf only has the 
background color (color name="toolbox") . If you are using 0.7-dev, I 
have a patch (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-518) that adds 
the toolbox font to the skinconf for color group: Forrest so you can 
just change them there without mucking in the css directly if you use 
that color group.

I originally hacked away at the css files to get the colors I needed but 
then I figured out how to use the skinconf file to set everything except 
the toolbox font and then did the patch so that I don't need to edit any 
css files for my color scheme.  (I do still edit the css to position the 
logo images the way I want with no searchbox to push the float:right to 
the left.)

Depends on exactly what you want to do. If you want the site folder to 
appear in a different directory then you can change project.build-dir in 
forrest.properties. The problem with this is that all build files will 
appear in that location.

If you want to change the name of the root directory (i.e. something 
other than site). Or if you only want the site to appear in the dist 
directory then you will need to make some changes to Forrest. You can 
hack a solution or you could add a new property to forrest.properties 
called project.site-dir and use that.

Either way you need to make changes in 
FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/forrest-build.xml look for:

<if>
         <equals arg1="${project.i18n}" arg2="true"/>
         <then>
           <property name="project.site-dir" 
location="${project.build-dir}/site/${user.language}"    />
         </then>
         <else>
           <property name="project.site-dir" 
location="${project.build-dir}/site"    />
         </else>
     </if>

If you do it the proper way (adding a property), please add the property to:

FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/default-forrest.properties

and in fresh-site/forrest.properties

make the default value what it is now, i.e. ${project.build-dir)/site

create a patch and add it to our issue tracker.

The extra effort will be worthwhile as it will mean you don't need to 
hack your version of Forrest everytime you upgrade.

I'll preface this with the fact I do not understand sitemaps and while I 
have been trying to wrap my head around it for two days, I have way too 
much other stuff going on to figure them out beyond the basic concept.  
In order to really make my pitch to my boss to use Forrest I need to be 
able to use WordPerfect docs with it.  WordPerfect does publish to XML, 
but using the DocBook DTD, not Simplified DocBook.  I tried following 
the faq (http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/faq.html#docbook) about 
using DocBook but I don't really get it all.  I do have Norman Walsh's 
DocBook stylesheets and I put them into 
PROJECT_HOME\src\documentation\resources\stylesheets.

With this sitemap.xmap (just following the example in the faq):
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map:sitemap xmlns:map="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0">
 <map:pipelines>
  <map:pipeline>
   <map:match pattern="**wp.html">
    <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}{1}wp.xml"/>
    <map:transform
      src="{project:resources.stylesheets}/docbook.xsl"/>
    <map:serialize type="xhtml"/>
   </map:match>
  </map:pipeline>
 </map:pipelines>
</map:sitemap>

It fails at linkmap.html with a long bunch of treeprocessor stuff, and 
this BROKEN message:
URI not found: Type 'xhtml' does not exist for 'map:serialize' at file: 
PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/sitemap.xmap:9:34

Any help is appreciated.
Thanks
Addi

First of all, have you tried just using the simplified-docbook plugin? 
It will recognise the DTD and use the available stylesheets. For a lrge 
number of docbook files this produces good results.

You need to define the xhtml serializer used in <map:serialize 
type="xhtml"/> in the components section of the sitemap.

See http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/serializers/xhtml-serializer.html
for the elements you need to add to define this component. You can see 
examples in the FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/sitemap.xmap.

(I'll add this to the FAQ, thanks for pointing it out)

Yes, I did try the s-docbook plugin and I have s-docbook documents 
rendering fine with it, but I get nothing when I use a docbook DTD.  I 
had peeked at the s-docbook plugin files and it *looked* like it would 
do what I wanted since input.xmap had the docbook DTDs and the xsl had 
book and chapter elements, so I tried that first but it didn't give me 
anything when I built the site.  (The DTD itself and the book and 
chapter elements are the only things in these files that are not 
s-docbook.)  If I change the DTD to simplified, change book to article 
and delete chapter elements, it renders fine. Any ideas on what to look 
at to figure out why s-docbook plugin isn't doing it for me?

Excellent, thanks for that. Looks simple enough.

Yes, this is a well-written howto.  As its example demonstrates,  It 
could benefit from the two things I learned (pelt-specific?), however.

1)  The background-color needed for the rounded corners at the bottom of 
the pelt menu to blend in with the background of the page is the value 
white used for "content" (or "main"), not "body" (the initial value) 
unless "body" happens to remain set to "#FFFFFF" (white). Changing the 
"body" color something else (e.g., to match "footer" to visually extend 
the bottom frame to fill the screen) shows up in the background points 
of the rounded menu corners. Thus, one may need to add to skinconf.xml a 
"missing" color:

<color name="content" value="#FFFFFF" />


2)  The new color-name, "content" in my case (or "foo" as in the 
example), must then be used in screen.css, as per the example:

background-image: url(images/rc-b-r-15-1content-2menu-3menu.png);

but also in site2xhtml.xsl:

 <div id="roundbottom">
            <img 
                src="{$skin-img-dir}/rc-b-l-15-1content-2menu-3menu.png" 
                alt="" width="15" height="15" class="corner" 
                style="display: none" />
        </div>

Thanks for your help,
Maurice

Thanks for the clues!  I should have known there was still a file I 
hadn't visited-- profile.css.xslt.  Now I see that, as you say,
for #menu .menupagetitle 
  - Dialog font is used
  - toolbox backgroundcolor is used
I had ignored (commented out) these values in skinconf because they 
seemed useless.  Now I have set them in skinconf and have the (pleasing) 
result I wanted without changing anything in profile.css.xslt or screen.css.

And I, too, edit the css to position my logo image near center!

Thanks,
Maurice
    <color name="toolbox" value="#BFFFDF" font="#000000"/>

Verify that the documenttype output by WordPerfect is matched by the 
simplified-docbook plugin. If the documenttype does not appear in the 
list of recognised DTD's you will need to add it to the plugin. There 
are a few examples in there already (see output.xmap)

This method should work. It did last time that i tried it. 
I have a site that i will be using as one on my tests for the
upcoming release that uses full DocBook, so i will try over
the next few days.

You need to ensure that the Public Identifier in the top of your
xml instances is exactly one of those specified in the sitemap
plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.simplified-docbook/input.xmap

Well then.  I had checked it before but this time I copied it from 
input.xmap and pasted and it worked.  I went back to look more closely 
and WP is missing one slash in the DTD.  They have -//OASIS/DTD DocBook 
XML V4.2//EN vs. -//OASIS*//*DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN.  I have a call in 
to Corel asking them tell me how to hack WP to output the correct DTD.

Once I get the WP DTD sorted out, I will be golden but related to the 
serializer issue, I added the serializer to my project sitemap using the 
cocoon example.  I am testing this separately from the DTD/plugin 
solution above and now I am getting the page (yeah!) but in raw xhtml, 
not skinned.  Is this related to the 0.7 raw html discussion that has 
been going on (that I didn't really follow)?  I'm sorry that the whole 
process isn't really clear to me at this point so I have difficulty 
self-troubleshooting and I keep asking more questions everytime you answer.

Thanks
Addi

If it cannot be done then provide a patch for the plugin with a note of 
why it is needed and we'll apply it, I'm sure others may want to do thins.

Incidentally, I do have another solution, that is better still but needs 
some work. In sort use OOo running in server mode to convert from 
WordPerfect to OOo, then use the OOo plugin to get it into Forrest. This 
woks great for MSOffice. Problem is only OOo2 supports word perfect (I 
think) and our OOo plugin doesn;t support the new OpenDocument format.

That's no problem. Soon you'll know the answers and will answer other 
users questions. We all start somewhere.

To skin the content you need to change the sitemap entry to to:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map:sitemap xmlns:map="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0">
  <map:pipelines>
   <map:pipeline>
    <map:match pattern="resolver-*.xml">
     <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}resolver-{1}.xml"/>
     <map:transform
 
src="file:///usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets/xhtml/docbook.xsl"/>
     <map:transform src="{forrest:stylesheets}/html2document.xsl" />
     <map:serialize type="xml"/>
    </map:match>
   </map:pipeline>
  </map:pipelines>
</map:sitemap>

The differences are that we are responding to a request for XML rather 
than HTML now. Forrest makes a request for an xml document as part of 
its resolving of HTML requests. That request will come here, we generate 
XHTMl using the docbook stylesheets, then we convert that to XDoc then 
the calling pipeline does the skinning.

There is a pretty good description of this process (from a differentuse 
case) in 
http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/howto/howto-custom-html-source.html#Understanding%20the%20HTML-Pipeline

I *think* this will work but I've not tried it. Pleae let us know how 
you get on, even if it doesn't work, I'll help you debug it because this 
is something we have come across before now and have hoped to test out.

Hi,
I'm trying to separate my forrest content from the actual webapp(war).
So I would like to have project.content-dir refer to an absolute path
/.../.....=20
However Forrest keeps adding "webapps/my-project/project/" before this
path.=20

Any suggestions?

Hi All.

I have been working to use a background image for the tabs. I've found in screen.css that I can change the graphic used for the rounded edges on the top left and right corners of the tabs, but I can't figure out how to set the background image for the rest of the tab. I've played around with setting the repeat value, but I can't get it to look the way I want it to (I end up with one corner round and the other not rounded).

I noticed that I can set the background color for selected and unselected tabs in the skinconfig.xml file, but this seems to only want a color value.

So, have I missed something obvious? Is there a way to use an image for the tab background?

As usual, links and advice are welcome.

Thanks.

See the skin kindly donated by Verit (http://www.verit.de) in

Thanks for that, it definitely helped.  I am beginning to get a fuzzy

Well, I modified the sitemap and it didn't like the change.  I now get 
nothing with this:
    <map:pipelines>
      <map:pipeline>
       <map:match pattern="**wp.xml">
        <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}{1}wp.xml"/>
        <map:transform
          
src="file:///C:/xsl/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.68.1/xhtml/docbook.xsl"/>
        <map:transform src="{forrest:stylesheets}/html2document.xsl" />
        <map:serialize type="xml"/>
       </map:match>
      </map:pipeline>
    </map:pipelines>

I realize that you are busy this week with the release and I am not in a 
rush to get this figured out, so we can come back to this when you have 
the time.  Thanks for your help.

====================================
    Yes your trick works. I think it doesn't kill the eclipse because
eclipse in the task manager appears as eclipse.exe and is running javaw.exe
rather than java.exe which the hack is killing.

Ah, right. Thanks for explaining that. It means that one needs to be
careful as you might kill other java-based software nevertheless.

Which is preciseky why we created the Eclipse plugin. Your proposed 
method is dangerous.

This is becoming an increasingly common request on this list. After the 
0.7 release I will create a release for the plugin and make it available 
via the Eclipse upgrade mechanism.

Comment out the second transform, what do you see when requesting 
"***wp.xml"

There is currently a bug in html2document that results in no content

Hallo,

my forrest version 0.6 is working wonderful. Now I try 0.7 (Rev: 190747  
from
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk). When I do

     ./build.sh clean

in forrest/main it works, but when I do

     ./build.sh

it fail. Can you tell me why? My Computer is an Apple with MacOSX  
10.3.9. The Error is:

Building forrest using Linux/PowerPC, IBM java 1.4.2 and a UTF-8 locale, I=

have to issue the following command to make forrest build:
LANG=3DC ./build.sh

I don't know if this solves your issue, though.

I am also on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and i get no such problems. The build
is fine for me. What is your version of Java? Here is mine:

[site-author]$ java -version
java version "1.4.2_05"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_05-141.4)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-38, mixed mode)

Have you changed anything in the sources? Please do this to be sure ...
cd /Users/udo/forrest
svn status --no-ignore
... it should reveal only the top-level "build" directory as extra.
If you had got past the build stage and 

I get something different to you at  the "compile" target below.
I get ...
compile:
Created dir: /svn/asf/forrest/build/classes
Compiling 31 source files to /svn/asf/forrest/build/classes

Really we would prefer people to be testing the "release candidate"
as requested rather than testing the current trunk.

Did this and requesting **wp.xml with the first transform gives me de

I looked at this but I don't grasp it all enough for it to give me any 
insight.

BTW, related but aside, I finally talked to Corel Priority WordPerfect 
support and they agreed that they have a typo in their output but it is 
hardcoded in the app so I can't hack it.  They have notified the dev 
team, so hopefully future versions (or a patch) will incorporate the 
change.  So I will need to edit each WP "publish to XML" file and add 
the missing slash.  (I sense a script coming on...)  I'm not sure if 
this is really worth patching Forrest for since WP use is probably 
pretty limited.

I don't see that behaviour in today's trunk (r190851).
So i presume that it is fixed.

It's exactly the same java.

I only followed http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/build.html

Now I get it from: svn co 
'http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/branches/forrest_07_branch/' 
forrest
I hope this is the right. It works fine :-)

I am interesting on 0.7 not the absolute latest trunk. I am Happy. 
Thanks for the help.

The final release is made from the trunk on Friday (as long as there
are no major issues) and the changes are merged into the branch.

I still have no such problems with the current trunk.
All that i can suggest is that you do a fresh checkout of trunk.

I reckon Udo does not have any problems either with head anymore. Like
you said that means it will be fixed for the release as well and Udo can
use the official 0.7 release.

No it is not fixed. The plugins/index.html file is generated from the 
plugins.xml file in the plugins directory. This has not been included in 
the build and so it is missing. It works with trunk because you have it 
checked out.

I will alter the build file so that the plugins subdirectory, the 
plugins.xml, the build.xml and the plugin-template are all present in 
the distribution. This will allow users to build plugins.

If the page is skinned then you did not request **wp.xml, you must have 
requested **wp.html. We need to verify that you are getting the docbook 
file as html then we need to work out why it is not succsefully being 
converted to an xdoc.

I think what is happening is that the HTML produced by your docbook xsl 
is not being processed by the html2document.xsl because of the above 
bug. Once you can see your html output from the first phase we can 
confirm that this is/is not the case and proceed to solve the problem.

There is another alternative that may interest you, although it requires 
a little work. Recently I needed to include MS Word documents in a 
Forrest site. These documents were constantly being edited so it was not 
really an option to manually save them each time (often they were edited 
outside of the organsiation so there was no control over the save format).

The solution I came up with is a plugin that uses OpenOffice to convert 
the MS Word documents to OOo documents, then we use the OOo plugin to 
include them in the Forrest site. You could do the same thing for your 
WP documents.

The only problem is only OOo v2 has WP support so some changes to the 
generator may be needed to get the interaction with OOoV2 going.

The benefit is that you don't have to manually save files in an external 
format and you don't need to work around the docbook Doctype bug in WP.

The plugin is not available via Apache because the license of some of 
the libs is not compatible. However, I can make it available to you if 
you want me to. I intend to publish it soon, I just haven't got around 
to it yet.

I tested it, but it has no affect. I think I found my error.

I think it was my error. I had copy the files to another place. Now I
use the trunk files directly and it works :-)

Hello -

I'm a new user of Forrest, and am investigating its use as an interface for
our online computer code documentation. Unfortunately, we will need two
different 'views' of the site - one for internal users and a second, more
restricted version for external users.

Simply put, there will be some information (some links) which we only wish
to show to our internal users.

I'm hoping to be able to generate these two views without duplicating
information, to minimize maintenance cost and errors.

So, my question is, can I somehow mark certain portions of the information,
then do two builds - one for internal, with "include=all" and one for
external with "exclude=somestuff"?

Pointers to existing information or any other advice will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

We came across a similar situation, too.
Publishing for two (or more) different
audiences.

Our "solution" has been to use different
project-specific sitemaps that tailor the
information passed on for each audience.
I guess this may be done with a plugin as
well.

You will have to mark the parts that you
want to remove in some way. We have an
internal DTD which contains the necessary
semantic information (e.g. about versions).

I admitt this is a sub-optimal solution
but it uses the very same XML sources.

Hope this helps and points you in the right
direction.

I am answering you because you said you are in the process of evaluating
forrest. What I am going to write is *not* fully included in the 0.7
release (it is in the whiteboard) but will hopefully go officially into
0.8.

We have created a new skinning engine that we called "views". With this
engine it will be possible to define *role specific* views within *one*
file. Right now this new engine is only a prototype implementation but
we will work on it once we did the 0.7 release.

Like I stated in the introduction I just mention that because you said
you are evaluating forrest. ...and we already have one site that is
build with views: http://resolute.ucsd.edu/diwaker

example.

Forrest displays a dtdt not found message. It searches the dtd file in the 
current directory and not in the src/documentation/resources/schema/dtd 

So I put the dtdt file in the current directory and it works well.
 
Do I missed something or is it a problem in the documentation.

You missed something with setting up the Catalog Entity Resolver.

If you simply put the DTD in the current directory then you would
need to have copies in any sub-directories, or use relative paths
in each xml instance. Messy.

Are you sure that you followed the instructions?

Hi, I am trying to figure out where I should add some CSS code so that=20

 it will apply to my site.  I have added it to the skinconf.xml with no=20

 apparent luck.  I added the code in <extra-css> and the code is the

 following:

=20

 img.floatleft {

=20

             float: left

=20

         margin: 10px 10px 0 0 ;

=20

 }

=20

 =20

=20

 I then reference it in one of my xml documents as <img
class=3D"floatleft"

 src=3D"images/notes_Sideview.png">

=20

 =20

=20

 Does anyone have any idea what to do or where to add the code?  Thanks=20

 so much.  Dana

this is a good place to start and experiment.
But you have to be sure that your css is correct or else everything
that comes after your coding error is ignored.

Which seems to be the problem here. The missing semicolon after
'float: left' is probably the culprit as far as I can tell.

Please, please, please can you provide an example or a brief document 
for this when you get the time. I have a use case that I would like to 
address in the next couple of weeks and was going to go with the two 
site.xml files and a request parameter to select between them. Since the 
site is views based I'd like to try out this new method.

Hi, I am trying to use an unordered list in <p> tags but it won't allow
me to.  The following is the error I am receiving.  Is there a way I
could still do an unordered list in a paragraph? =20

The content of element type "p" must match
"(strong|em|code|sub|sup|br|img|icon|acronym|a)".

I would like to use the <ul> tags if possible.  Thanks, Dana

Instead of:

<p>
   blah blah
   <ul>
     <li>list item</li>
     <li>list item</li>
   </ul>
   blah blah
</p>

Just do:

<p>
   blah blah
</p>
<ul>
   <li>list item</li>
   <li>list item</li>
</ul>
<p>
   blah blah
</p>

(note a paragraph is a group of sentences, so list, ordered or otherwise 
has no place inside a paragraph)

Not everyone would agree that lists (and long quotations) never have 
their place in paragraphs.  The essence of a paragraph is that it treats 
or develops a single point. It may be a short phrase, or even just a 
word in a dialogue, or quite long. Discussion of a list's content may 
well belong in the same paragraph as its introduction.

The work-around of placing the list between two paragraphs may be 
satisfactory, at least when the list begins or ends the paragraph. 
However, if the paragraphs are indented, the reader may not easily 
recognize that the end of the discussion is the continuation of the same 
point.  As Strunk and White caution,

In the DocBook model, "ordinary para can contain most types of block 
elements", and Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner use an itemized list to 
illustrate this. (http://www.docbook.org/tdg/simple/en/html/para.html).  
It is simpara, simple paragraphs, which cannot contain block elements.

You have made some important points. Thanks for sharing them, I
learned a lot.

Yet the level of understanding required is clearly beyond a great
number of content authors so Forrest defaults to a much simpler
HTML-like structure which does have these limitations for the sake of
simplicity.

The beauty of the Forrest system is that an advanced writer such as
yourself can easily use docbook as an input format and even tune the
docbook-input-plugin (Forrest 0.7 and up) in such a way that these
distinctions are expressed in the final output.

That is a statement about the *display* (or style) of the information 
not about the contextual *mark-up* of the information. If you want to 
change the *style* of something being output then you use  class attributes:

<p class="indent">blah blah</p>
<ul class="indent">
   ...
</ul>
<p class="indent">...</p>

This allows you to format the content appropriately for the given output 
medium (which is what Forrest is all about) and context. Remember that 
although this user was writing directly in XDoc this is not requried by 
Forrest, we support a very wide range of input formats.

Of course, you can achieve the same effect with embedded lists, but not 
with our Documentv2.0. If there is enough demand to do this we will 
change the DTD accordingly since we are movng towards using a subset of 
XHTML2 as out intermediate language and XHTML2 allows lists embedded in 
para's.

It seems to me this *is* about the contextual "mark-up" of the
information as opposed to style.  The point is that a list of items
can logically be contained in a paragraph and the current workaround
to close the para and make sibling ULs is in some cases incorrect when
the list does logically belong with the paras topic.  The current way
makes sense probably because folks have traditional
html-style-bulleted-list display on their mind but take away a
bulleted list and the original guy's argument makes more sense to me
at least.  For example, a simple paragraph like:

<p>I have a one-acre vegetable garden this summer.  In my garden I
grow the following: <ul>
   <li>tomatoes</li>=20
   <li>corn</li> =20
   <li>squash</li>
   <li>cucumbers</li>
</ul>
While the garden is growing well, I could use a bit more rain.</p>

styled to be:

"I have a one-acre vegetable garden this summer.  In my garden I grow
the following: tomatoes, corn, squash, and cucumbers.  While the
garden is growing well, I could use a bit more rain."

There is an unordered list that logically belongs subordinate to the
para element in my mind.  It's only for style reasons that one might
suggest doing the following:

<p>I have a one-acre vegetable garden this summer.  In my garden I
grow the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>tomatoes</li>
  <li> corn</li>
   <li> squash</li>
   <li> cucumbers</li>
</ul>

<p> While the garden is growing well, I could use a bit more rain.</p>

Either way, docbook could just be used but it seemed to me that there
is more to the list/paragraph relationship than just style.
--tim

(on a side note, the corn isn't doing so well)

Hi all.
I've gotten to a point in my site design where I'm comfortable showing what I have so far for feedback. I've put up a bare skeleton of what will eventually be the completed site at:

http://hokum.freehomepage.com/site/index.html

I started with the forrest-site skin and modified it. I cleaned out some of the formatting that was the xsl and put it into the css file. I figure there will have to be some tweaking of styles and I want to do some testing with graphics turned off.

I do have a few questions.

1. I've set <trail location="none"> and left the links blank but the trail is still appearing. Well, that's not entirely true, on my computer, they weren't showing up but they showed up when I uploaded it. Any thoughts?

2. I've got the font-resize feature turned on but the buttons aren't showing up.

3. In Netscape, there's a gap between the Search box and the top of the tabs (you'll see what I mean if you look). This gap isn't in IE. I'm assuming it's because of the spacer graphic that's there. Any thoughts of fixing this or is this going to be one of those "browser conflict" issues?

4. The XML files that Forrest is generating are using:
<!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC "-//APACHE//DTD Documentation V1.3//EN" "document-v13.dtd">. This is giving me an error. My xdocs have a different doctype that doesn't give an error:
<!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC "-//APACHE//DTD Documentation V2.0//EN" "http://forrest.apache.org/dtd/document-v20.dtd">
Any thoughts on how to put the correct doctype into the XML output files?

I guess that's it for now.

Any suggestions and help are appreciated. The list has been very helpful so far.

Thanks.

Hello,

I tried to use a UTF-8 encoded HTML file as source file (for skinning  
etc.), but the UTF-8 got garbled (was treated as Latin1/stream of  
single bytes). I didn't at the time have the possibility to check for  
ways to configure this, but it appears to me that when a properly  
encoded and marked-up HTML file is read, Forrest should honour the  
encoding info in the file, and use that encoding when reading it.

The OpenOffice input plugin will treat UTF-8 correctly (I assume  
UTF-8 is the default encoding of OpenOffice), but alas, it returned  
the tables as paragraphs. Thus, with the source files I had, I was  
forced to choose between proper character rendering or proper table  
rendering:-/

Anyone any experience or hints on this one?

Regards,
Sjur

Don't forget that the "forrest-site" skin is deprecated and will be
removed in a future release. We are not doing anything to maintain it.

Subject: Forrest (svn head) war is crashing Tomcat upon restart

Hello,

I'm having some problems with the present svn head (two days old): the  
war it creates installes fine in Tomcat when deployed through Tomcat's  
HTML Manager, and as long as Tomcat is running without interruption,  
there's no problem. But when restarted, Tomcat crashes severely. This  
happens only when the Forrest war is installed, without the Forrest  
war, there is no problem.

Config:
- (almost) latest Forrest svn

Hello,

Our project documentation, based on Forrest, went public yesterday:

Address: http://www.divvun.no/
Description: S=E1mi proofing tools development project


Another site partially using Forrest also opened yesterday:

Address: http://www.risten.no/
Description: S=E1mi terminology portal

(this last one has background documentation in Forrest, the main page =20=

is made with eXist+Cocoon)

Regards,
Sjur

How almost?

That sounds dangerous. When using the trunk, you should always keep
your config up-to-date. Not saying that this is the cause, but still.

Did this work for you before, or is this the first time that you
have tried to use Forrest as a war archive?

Do the Cocoon log files reveal anything?

Does a bare 'forrest seed war' work okay?

I can't make much sense of the log sorry, but it looks like some
sort of log configuration problem. Whose?

I believe the only way to do this in the 0.6 release is to add it to a 
custom skin.

In 0.7 (being released almost as I type) there is a new Message of the 
Day feature that allows you to do this, see 
http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/index.html for an example (in this 
example it also appears on the upper right of the page, but you can turn 
that off).

The MOTD can be changed on a per directory basis, see skinconf.xml from 
a 0.7 "seed" site for configuration details.

As the name suggests it was created for a different purpose but it may 
serve your needs.

Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.7
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms
input from various sources into a unified presentation
in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible
plugin architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant
standards, which separates presentation from content.
Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.

New features in this version include
------------------------------------

  * An architecture for Plugins which enables a smaller Forrest
    core and the ability to add new features in a modular way.

Important Changes Code Base
---------------------------

  * [Icon: add] Added org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.dtdx plugin by moving
    functionality out of the core. Generates DTD documentation using a
    custom Cocoon Generator. (DC) Fixes FOR-389 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-389].
  * [Icon: add] Added a plugin to handle input documents from Microsoft
    Excel. (RDG) Thanks to Johannes Schaefer. Fixes FOR-373 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-373].
  * [Icon: add] Added external plugin POD-input to allow Plain Old
    Documentation (POD) files to be included in a Forrest site. (RDG)
    Thanks to Ron Blaschke.
  * [Icon: add] Moved POD output from the common skin to its own plugin.
    (RFT)
  * [Icon: add] Added a text-output plugin. (RFT) Fixes FOR-125 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-125].
  * [Icon: add] Added photoGallery plugin. (RDG) Thanks to Jörg Werner.
    Fixes FOR-387 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-387].
  * [Icon: add] Enable sitemap plugins. Plugins allow Forrest to have
    functionality added through the addition of small code blocks
    (plugins). Plugins are downloaded automatically when a site that
    requires them is built. See Extending Forrest with Plugins [Link:
    pluginDocs/plugins_0_80/usingPlugins.html]. (RDG)
  * [Icon: add] The brokenlinks file now contains referer information.
    Upgraded lib/core/cocoon.jar and added attribute "show-referrers" to
    the Cocoon cli.xconf (DC) Thanks to Upayavira. Fixes FOR-204 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-204].
  * [Icon: remove] Merge xdocs and raw files in the same directory
    src/document/content/xdocs (JJP)
  * [Icon: update] Enhanced the Message of the Day (MOTD) facility. See
    skinconf.xml from a "seed" site for configuration details. Append a
    small text string after html title. Add text to a panel on the page.
    Select different messages depending on the URI string pattern. To use
    it, declare skinconfig-v07-1.dtd in your skinconf.xml file. (DC)
  * [Icon: update] Reinstate error reporting for broken "site:" and "ext:"
    links which are due to missing entries in site.xml or typos in site:
    links. The text "error:" is also prepended. This is a workaround for
    bug FOR-284 "link rewriting broken when linking to xml source views
    which contain site: links". This latter issue is handled by the core.
    However, if your project uses a Cocoon cli.xconf [Link:
    docs_0_70/faq.html#cli-xconf] then you will need add the same "exclude"
    entries. (DC) Fixes FOR-284 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-284].
  * [Icon: update] Moved status "changes" and "todo" page generation to the
    org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.projectInfo plugin. (RDG)
  * [Icon: update] Java 1.4 is required [Link:
    docs_0_70/faq.html#requirements] starting with Forrest-0.7-dev (DC)

Important Changes Documentation
-------------------------------

  * [Icon: add] Added How to customize processing of html source [Link:
    docs_0_70/howto/howto-custom-html-source.html] (DC) Thanks to Ferdinand
    Soethe. Fixes FOR-446 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-446].
  * [Icon: add] Added How-To Run Forrest from Maven [Link:
    docs_0_70/howto/howto-forrest-from-maven.html]. (RDG) Thanks to Ian P.
    Springer. Fixes FOR-369 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-369].
  * [Icon: add] Added How-To Build a plugin [Link:
    docs_0_70/howto/howto-buildPlugin.html]. (RDG)
  * [Icon: add] Added HowTo about editing CSS [Link:
    docs_0_70/howto/howto-editcss.html] in a WYSIWYG fashion using Mozilla
    Firefox and its Edit-CSS plugin. (RDG) Thanks to Ferdinand Soethe.
  * [Icon: update] Rewrote example of raw content in fresh-site to
    correctly document the behaviour in 0.7. (RDG) Fixes FOR-470 [Link:
    http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_id=FOR-470].
  * [Icon: update] Removed ihtml example from fresh-site and replaced with
    an example of embedded HTML. The use of ihtml is now deprecated in
    favour of embedded HTML. (RDG)
  * [Icon: update] Updated How-To: How to create a PDF document for each
    tab [Link: docs_0_70/howto/howto-pdf-tab.html] to create
    subject-specific aggregated documents. (TS)

Hi Ross,

Thanks. I will try to upgrade to 0.7 and give it a go. I'll be sure to
share my findings when I try to tailor it for my needs.

Thanks,
Rus

Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to automatically split a "document"
into multiple pages based upon the number of "section"s in a
"document" and have this reflected in the menu, or better yet have a
page navigation header+footer around the body content.




Thanks,
Rus

That MOTD facility is rather limited. It is only meant for a small
snippet of text.

The other way is to use the "credit" elements in skinconf with
box-location="alt" which puts an image (not text) into that
whitespace. That is improved in 0.7 but still not for text.
Follow how it is implemented in the "pelt" stylesheets.
Perhaps you can tweak that to enable more than images.

In Forrest 0.8 there will be Views will will enable nuggets of
data to be placed in various page locations.

I'm not entirley sure what you mean, do you mean. There is no concept of 
pages (as in page 1, 2 and 3) in HTML documents. There is a page break 
feature in 0.7 that allows page breaks to be inserted into PDF 
documents, these can also be used in HTML documents, but again this only 
  makes sense if you are printing.

See http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/faq.html#pageBreaks

If you mean having one document create x separate pages in the web site 
then you will need to create a custom skin and do your pagination in there.

With respect to your "page navigation header+footer around the body 
content" do you mean a table of contents? See 
http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/your-project.html for an example?

Forrest can generate a TOC to any depth of headings and can be placed at 
the top of a document as in the above example or in the menu on the 
left. See skinconf.xml for how to configure the TOC.

By customising the skin you could make it appear elsewhere (like in the 
footer as well).

I built the sample site using forrest and everything is ok.  My question =
is
about the tab menu at the top of the page.  I can't seem to find the css =
for
"base-selected" or "base-not-selected" anywhere and would like to know =
where
it's coming from.  I'd really like to lift this into a tiles project I'm
working on.

Thanks.

Yes that is what i was aiming to express.

I am not sure if it is feasible or desirable for general forrest
usage, but basically I want to be able to, in skinconf.xml, do
something like:


<toc location=3D"page" max-depth=3D"1" min-sections=3D"10"
max-sections=3D"20"  page-navigation-location=3D"menu | bodyHeaderFooter"/>

In this scenarios, if a document has more than 20 sections, let's say
60, then three html pages (with 20 toc entries) would be generated
with links to the other pages in the menu or in a body subHeader and
subFooter in a structure like:


-pageHeader
-menu4CurrentTab
-pageNavigationBodyHeader - PAGE 1 --> page 2 --> page 3
(upper-case=3Dcurrent page)
-TOC (20 items)
-Sections(20 items)
-pageNavigationBodyFooter - PAGE 1 --> page 2 --> page 3
-pageFooter

I would be glad to customize a skin or skins and contribute this work
if you find that it sounds useful to the larger community, but I would
need a little direction from you and maybe the other developers about
where and how to add such functionality.

Rus

It is located in {projectdir}/build/site/skin/profile.css.  Tab selected 
is #top .header .current and unselected is #tabs.  It's not terribly 
clear when looking at that file but if you go look at profile.css.xslt 
you can see that's how it is mapped:

<xsl:template match="color[@name='tab-selected']">
#top .header .current { background-color: <xsl:value-of select="@value"/>;}
#top .header .current a:link {  color: <xsl:value-of select="@link"/>;  }
#top .header .current a:visited { color: <xsl:value-of select="@vlink"/>; }
#top .header .current a:hover { color: <xsl:value-of select="@hlink"/>; }
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="color[@name='tab-unselected']">
#tabs li      { background-color: <xsl:value-of select="@value"/> ;}
#tabs li a:link {  color: <xsl:value-of select="@link"/>;  }
#tabs li a:visited { color: <xsl:value-of select="@vlink"/>; }
#tabs li a:hover { color: <xsl:value-of select="@hlink"/>; }
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="color[@name='subtab-selected']">
#level2tabs       { background-color: <xsl:value-of select="@value"/> ;}
#level2tabs a:link {  color: <xsl:value-of select="@link"/>;  }
#level2tabs a:visited { color: <xsl:value-of select="@vlink"/>; }
#level2tabs a:hover { color: <xsl:value-of select="@hlink"/>; }
</xsl:template>

Not sure if this will meet sure needs, but worth a try ...

Cocoon has a Paginator Transformer:
http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/howto/howto-paginator-transformer.html

Add that to your project sitemap.

Hmm, I don't get it, but then I don't do anything really complex in css.
Anyhow, I see a reference to a style of "base-selected" within the href =
and
a "current" in tne <li> for them tab menu.  I can't find "base-selected"
anywhere in the static site except in html files here it's in use.  What =
I'm
really interested in is seeing how the rounded corners are managed =
without
using images.  I figure it has something to do with the css on the <li>.
Here's the section of the generated html I'm looking at:

<ul id=3D"tabs">
<li class=3D"current">
<a class=3D"base-selected" href=3D"index.html">Home</a>
</li>
<li>
<a class=3D"base-not-selected" href=3D"samples/sample.html">Samples</a>
</li>
<li>
<a class=3D"base-not-selected" href=3D"http://xml.apache.org">Apache XML
Projects</a>
</li>
<li>
<a class=3D"base-not-selected"
href=3D"pluginDocs/plugins_0_70/index.html">Plugins</a>
</li>
</ul>

Hi David,

Thanks for that link. I have actually seen it before in my previous
work with Cocoon, but have never actually used it. I plan on trying to
get it integrated into my forrest environment early next week.

I guess this question is better for the forrest-dev list, but if you
guys think this kind of functionality is interesting for larger use
can you give me a overview of the process need to implement such a
feature? I assume I would need to:

1) have a new element or edit an existing element in the skinconf.xml
file (+a schema change) to parameterize the behavior
2) editing a sitemap or plugging in a new paging.xmap into the forrest
sitemap.xmap or one of its sub-sitemaps
3) edit the build.xml and properties to get this done and for testing
the functionality?
etc.

Regards,
Rus

Ah.  Well I can't find the css either but I could find the 
transformation where base-selected and base-not-selected are brought in, 
which looks like it is part of the process for determining which tab 
gets which colors.  As for the tab look though, actually the tabs *do* 
use images.  The basic tab is just css color, but the rounded corners 
are small images that Forrest makes for you by using base svg "rounded 
corner" images, applying the correct colors and then converting into png 
images on the fly during the build.  If you look in 
build\site\skin\images you will see the png corner images (all starting 
with rc-).

You should probably read the HowTo on Tab Corners if you haven't already.
http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/howto/howto-corner-images.html

There are also a number of css tutorials on the net if you look for css 
rounded corners.  There are a few methods that folks employ, depending 
on situation and all of the ones that I have encountered have required 
at least a small image.

Hmm, that all makes sense but then (when in IE) why don't get I the "save
as" highlighted for the image?  Perhaps png or svg aren't "supported" for
that.  I've done the rounded images before but I was hoping that they had a
better way so I won't have to generate the image files.

When an image is set as background-image in the css, you won't be able 
to get the image from clicking on it because there is no direct 
reference to its location on the server as there is when the image is in 
the html itself.  Your browser can not see where the image is to "save 
as".  You can get the image in your browser (and save it) by looking up 
the full name in the css and then direct your browser to 
forrest_site_url/skin/images/name_of_the_image. (e.g. 
http://156.132.92.4/skin/images/rc-b-r-5-1header-2tab-selected-3tab-selected.png).

One of the very early versions of Forrest had pagination enabled, 
somehow, it was later turned off because of problems. I can'r remember 
exactly how it was implemented or why it was turned off.

A detailed search of the archives may turn somehitng up. My quick search 
unearthed this thread [1] which seems to discuss how to use the 
paginator in Forrest.

Don't be put off by the fact the first mail starts with the tutorial now 
in Cocoon docs, there is some forrest specific stuff at the end. Also, 
bear in mind this is three years ago now so positions of files may well 
have changed, the paginator may have been enhanced, even the function of 
files may have changed. We can help you get up to date on the dev list.

Hmm, ok, except I couldn't find some of the css (base-selected and

it.
Thanks for the information.

Hi, folks!
 
I am a forrest newbie. I started to play with it a few days ago.
My first question is in the subject:
 
Does Forrest 0.7 require the system to be connected to internet?
 
I am running it on WinXP, SP2, Java 1.5. After unzipping and seeding a new
project I tried to compile a static site, but got a bunch of errors:

- cut
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

unpack-plugin:

ERROR
=====
       
Unable to retrieve the org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.pdf plugin.
There may be more information about the reason for this in output
above. The usual cause is that Forrest has been unable to download
the plugin descriptor file that indicates where this plugin is to be
downloaded from. If you are behind a firewall then set the proxy.host 
and proxy.port values in the forrest.properties file.

You may also like to check the value of the 
forrest.plugins.descriptors property in the forrest.properties file
and ensure that the locations indicated by that value are accessible
(note there should be no spaces in this property).

- cut
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------             

After I have set up the proxy details in the forrest.properties file, it run
successfully.
That is why I ask the question.

Possible workaround:
In the forrest output, the following row can be seen:

org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.pdf is not available in the build dir

In the FORREST_HOME directory there is a "build" dir and a "plugins" dir
which contains pdf plugin. After I have copied the plugins dir into the
build dir, the static content could be compiled too. Is this the correct
workaround? Or, is this a correction of the directory structure redesign
error?

Thanks for help.
Best regards,

Petr Posik

Only on the very first building of a site that requires a plugin that is =

not yet installed. In this case Forrest downloads any plugins that are=20
required.

However, once they are downloaded and installed they will be reused on=20
subsequent builds. The only time they will need to be downloaded again=20
is either:

a) you delete the installed plugins (in FORREST_HOME/build/plugins)

or

b) you request a different version of the plugin

Looks good. Especially since you seem to have uncovered some lost
knowledge about creating subtabs the right way.

Would you mind posting your site.xml and tabs.xml for studying here?

I found that getting sub-tabs on the default (home) tab
was easier than on the other named tabs.

The interaction between tabs.xml and site.xml (and especially sub-tabs)
is complex. I started recording some tips here. Can someone verify and
add more?

Hi,
I used forrest 0.6 and it woks fine. So I'd like to go to version 0.7.

I have updated the forrest.properties file with the proxy.host proxy.port 
values.
When I try to start forrest .07 I have on the screen indications that it 
fails to download the plug-ins.

 fetch-plugins-descriptors:
Fetching plugins descriptor: http://forrest.apache.org/plugins/plugins.xml
Getting: http://forrest.apache.org/plugins/plugins.xml
Error opening connection java.io.IOException
Error opening connection java.io.IOException
Error opening connection java.io.IOException


I suppose it is an authentication problem, because I work inside the 
intranet behind a proxy
and the rule is when somebody wants to look outside he should give name 
and authenticate with a password
. 
Should I first, by hand download files and then let forrest install the 
plug-ins,
or should I all manually install the plus-ins (and how),
or there is  another solution?

Sincerly yours
Paul

If your proxy uses http basic authentication we could add the facility 
to provide a username and password in your user properties file. If this 
will be of use please raise an issue on our issue tracker.

You can manually install the plugins you need by downloading the zip 
files you need (their locations are indicated at 
http://forrest.apache.org/pluginDocs/plugins_0_70/index.html These zips 
should be unpacked into FORREST_HOME/build/plugins

Hi, once again.

Would it be a problem to include all plugins (or the basic ones, if their
size is an issue) in the forrest distribution package? Users which do not
have internet connection then could use forrest too. Or, perhaps, two
distributions of forrest could be provided - including and excluding
plugins.

Best regards,

Petr Posik

the plugin descriptor file that indicates where this plugin is to be
downloaded from. If you are behind a firewall then set the proxy.host

You may also like to check the value of the
forrest.plugins.descriptors property in the forrest.properties file
and ensure that the locations indicated by that value are accessible
(note there should be no spaces in this property).

&gt; I suppose it is an authentication problem, because I work inside the

name <br>

<br>
If your proxy uses http basic authentication we could add the facility

to provide a username and password in your user properties file. If this
<br>
will be of use please raise an issue on our issue tracker.<br>
<br>
&gt; Should I first, by hand download files and then let forrest install

&gt; or should I all manually install the plus-ins (and how),<br>
&gt; or there is &nbsp;another solution?<br>
<br>
You can manually install the plugins you need by downloading the zip <br>
files you need (their locations are indicated at <br>
http://forrest.apache.org/pluginDocs/plugins_0_70/index.html These zips
<br>
should be unpacked into FORREST_HOME/build/plugins<br>

One of the reasons for having plugins is to minimise the download size=20
and install footprint of Forrest. Furthermore, some plugins are not=20
hosted by Forrest as they are license incompatible with the ASF license. =

Therefore, we cannot bundle them with Forrest.

What we could do is create a separate bundle of all the ASF plugins so=20
that you could download them in one go. Would this help?

With respect to "users without Internet connections", I'm not sure what=20
you mean here, if they don't have an Internet connection they can't get=20
Forrest anyway (unless someone burns a CD for them, in which case the=20
above plugin bundle will do the job).

:-) With "users without internet connection" I mean such people which are
able to download the forrest instalation archive, but then turn off the
connection or leave their workplace to create their own personal almost
static sites at home. They unzip downloaded archive and ... "wow, it does
not work. Oh, it seems I had to be connected to the internet. OK, forrest is
not the right product for me because I want to work with it at home, in my
sparetime. OK, I will search another similar tool which allows me to do
so..."

So, yes, as for me the plugin bundle would be very helpful. Just to have
it... ready to run.

Thanks for the immediate responses... developers of other applications are
not usually so fast!  :-))

Best regards,

Petr Posik

Hi,

    I'd like to understand what are views, but it's a hard task.
    I tried the plug in documentation link in the forrest portal, but it 
is not good.
    http://forrest.apache.org/pluginDocs/plugins_0_70/index.html points 
to nothing...
   
    I also tried a link given in an old mail from Thorsten :
    http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/howto/howto-view-dsl.html
    which points to nothing too.

    Can you give me the good ones ? (please)
    Thanks,

Cyriaque,

Yes, I see your point. I will update the error message to make it clear=20
that Forrest only needs to be online for the first (and only first)=20
execution. It is probably also noting in the installation docs that if=20
you are trying to work offline you must first install the required=20
plugins whilst online (or download the proposed plugin collection).

One last thing worth noting is that Forrest does bundle the one plugin=20
that is required by the seed site used to create a new site. So in=20
actual fact you don't need to download any plugins to make it work first =

time.

In other words, the problem seems to be with the documentation, not with =

Forrest itself.

I'm in a "bitty" mood today, so I'm avoiding doing any "real" work :-)=20
Don't expect it every day, although we are proud of our responsiveness=20
on these lists.

It should be noted that we do not currently encourage users to use 
views. They work and some of the devs have started using them in a 
production environment, but they are alpha quality at this stage. That 
is qhy they are in the whiteboard.

Having said that, we welcome comments and feedback.

Yes, I think I have already discovered it... (WOW!)
That is why yesterday I sent (in another message thread in this list) the
following:

------------------------
Possible workaround:
In the forrest output, the following row can be seen:

org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.pdf is not available in the build dir

In the FORREST_HOME directory there is a "build" dir and a "plugins" dir
which contains pdf plugin. After I have copied the plugins dir into the
build dir, the static content could be compiled. Is this the correct
workaround? Or, is this a correction of the directory structure redesign
error?
------------------------

Is this the solution for seeding a new site? Then, a question arrises: why
the plugin for pdf output is not placed in the build directory directly, why
it must be coppied from the plugins dir?

That would work for the PDF plugin, but not for all plugins. Some must=20

An oversight in the build process. I added an RFE already.

Heres the link:
http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/howto/howto-asf-mirror.html

With the latest release, the docs were rearranged a bit causing some
of the mail-archived links to break.  If you navigate through
forrest.apache.org site you should be able to find any corresponding
pages.  If by chance that's what you did and that's where you came up
with the link that you reference, let us know so that it can be fixed.

The docs have been restructured to allow versioned documentation. You
want http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/howto/howto-asf-mirror.html

Did you find this link within the Forrest site or was it an old bookmark?

I added another .htaccess rule. It takes a few hours
to propagate to the website.

Please report any more issues.

Thank you Ross for this comment, I was wandering if I had to migrate to 
views or to continue - for a while - with my own skin.
I am going to continue like this and see what happens with views...

Hmm, I never answered on the comment of Ross, but IMO we *should*
encourage user to use views even if they are alpha.

Yes it is dev stuff and yes it is in the whiteboard because the
underlying design will change. 

Now to the biggest *but* why user should/can use views:
- the view format (*.fv) is quite constant and will be backward
compatible in the future.
- the contract template are as well quite stable

The main point is what just happened:
"I am going to continue like this and see what happens with views"
That is in the long run the dead of views! I and we need feedback of
*user* about views. I need somebody like you, Cyriaque, a dev and
on-the-best-way-to-committer that can help with design decisions and
testing.

Anyway, views are here to stay and are the future of forrest. That said
IMO it is better to change right now to views and help developing them.
Skin developing is similar to view development but skins are a dead end.

Be part of forrest, use views now. ;-)

WARNING: Views are under development and are considered unstable.

Please follow the instructions explicitly. It is so important
that i will repeat it here:
http://forrest.apache.org/howto/howto-buildPlugin.html#ant
<quote>
The following instructions rely heavily on Apache Ant to automate some
steps in the process. Since ant is distributed as part of Forrest,
all you need to do is add the ant executable directory to your system path.
The name of this directory is tools/ant/bin in your Forrest program
directory. (Alternatively you can prefix all calls to ant in the following
instructions with the full path of the ant binary directory.) Also clear
the ANT_HOME environment variable.

If instead you really want to use your own version of Ant, then you
will need to copy forrest/lib/core/xml-commons-resolver.jar to
$ANT_HOME/lib directory, otherwise your plugins will go across the
network to get the DTDs on every parse.

This also happens sometimes when you have not propoerly closed a comment 
and so a comment appears in side a comment. For example:

<!-- incorrectly closed comment ->
<anElement>withContent</anElement>
<1-- another comment -->

If you use an XML editor it will spot these errors for you.

They are generated from status.xml, see the projectINfo plugin for details.
